<h1> What is Recursion? </h1>
<p> The definition of recursion is "the repeated application of a recursive procedure (a procedure that calls itself)".
    Recursion is a way of solving a problem which involves some sort of repetition. </p>
<p> A recursive method has two parts, a base case and a recursive case. The recursive case is what is executed by
    default. It must also call itself in some way. asdfdnnnnnncmjcuuc. The base case is executed when a specific
    condition is met. It must also stop the recursion by not calling itself. </p>
<p> In a recursive method, returning values is very important. Conventionally, a recursive method will be a return
    method.
    The recursive case's return statement will always include calling itself to continue the recursion, and the base
    case's return statement will not. Return statements allows for tail recursion to be done, which adds something to
    the return value for every recursive call. </p>

    &nbsp;if (n % 2 == 1) {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br>
    &nbsp;}<br>
    &nbsp;return factorsOfTwo(n % 2) + 1;<br>
    } </p>
<p> In a recursive method, method parameters are also very important. This allows for values to be passed along as the
    recursion continues. </p>
<p> Variables can either be instance or local, which describes the d of the variables. Instance means they are defined
    at the class level, anything inside the class may use the variable since it has been defined outside of any blocks.
    Local means the variable is defined in some sort of block (of curly braces '{}'), which indicates the variable only
    exists within the occurence of the block. This happens most commonly inside methods, but may also happen inside
    loops or conditional statements. </p>
<h1> Recursion versus Iteration </h1>
<p> Recursion and iteration are very similar and can often be used in place of each other. Making the choice between
    either way of solving a problem depends on your limitations, and this is when knowing their advantages is essential
    for making the correct choice at times. </p>
<h2> Advantages of Recursion </h2>
<p> A recursive solution is often a much more simple and graceful solution than an iterative solution. </p>
<h2> Advantages of Iteration </h2>
<p> An iterative solution is often more efficient than a recursive one. Calling a function is much more perfomance-heavy
    than using a loop. It takes more time and each call will take up memory on the stack and cumulate depending on the
    depth of the recursion. If the recursion goes too deep and many resources are being used, a StackOverflowError will
    be thrown. With iteration, the stack does not have to keep track of what happened in the previous iterations, so
    less memory is used. </p>
