<h1> Who am I? </h1>
<p> My name is Nicholas Glenn and I'm a grade 10 student at William Lyon Mackenzie. I enjoy listening to music. At
    school, I'm part of the Computer Programming Club where I attend lessons, work on problems on online judges, and
    participate in computer programming competitions. </p>

<p> On my github, you'll be able to find all of my ICS projects listed in my past projects, including the source for
    this website! </p>

<p> In my spare time, I like to solve problems on WLMOJ, a clone of DMOJ made for the school of William Lyon Mackenzie.
    I use WLMOJ more than DMOJ because it's what I was exposed to at first and I get to compete head-on with others at
    my school. I find that doing competitive programming is a very good way for me to practice writing code and is very
    helpful for honing my problem-solving skills. </p>
