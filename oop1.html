<h1> What is OOP? </h1>
<p> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the representation of a program as objects. The Java language is completely
    based upon everything being represented as classes and objects. Objects are created by classes, which serve as a
    template for objects made of that class type. Objects are created by calling the class's constructor, which makes an
    instance of an object.
<p> If you have a class 'Animal', you may make an Animal object by calling its constructor with the same name, with
    parentheses to specify the parameters: <br>
    Animal doggy = new Animal(); <br>
    In this example, the class is Animal, the object is doggy, and doggy is set to an Animal created by the constructor
    Animal() with no parameters.
<p> A class consists of attributes and behaviors, known more formally as variables and methods respectively.
<p> Variables can either be instance or local, which describes the <b>scope</b> of the variables. Instance means they
    are defined at the class level, anything inside the class may use the variable since it has been defined outside of
    any blocks. Local means the variable is defined in some sort of block (of curly braces '{}'), which indicates the
    variable only exists within the occurrence of the block. This happens most commonly inside methods, but may also
    happen inside loops or conditional statements.
<p> Methods are often classified as accessors or mutators. Accessors retrieve the value of a variable and mutators
    change the value of a variable.
<p> One large reason why OOP exists is because of encapsulation. Information stored inside a class can stay hidden from
    the rest of your program. One process of encapsulation is by changing the <b>scope</b> of your variables. Another
    way is by using modifiers for instance variables and methods. There are two most widely-used access modifiers, being
    <i>public</i> and <i>private</i>. Public can be accessed by anything outside and inside of the class, but private
    can only be accessed by the class itself.
