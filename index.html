<p style="font-size: 18px"> This is my culminating portfolio for AP ICS. This portfolio displays what I've learned over the course, as well as
    what I've made in all my time taking ICS. On the "Who Am I?" page, I explain who I am and my interests. I have my
    past projects, some of which are my school projects and some being extracurricular. I've also made five lessons for
    each unit of ICS. These show what I've learned throughout the course. At the end of each lesson, you'll find a table
    of important terms that are crucial to gaining a better understanding of computer programming. The sources I've used
    to write my lessons and create this website can be found in the bibliography. </p>
