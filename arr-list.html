			<h1> Arrays </h1>
			<p> An array is a data structure which can hold multiple elements of one data type each located at indices. Arrays are 0-indexed, meaning the first index is index 0, the second is 1, and so on. The last index of an array will be its length minus one. Arrays have a fixed size, but their contents are not fixed. The array data type is specified by brackets '[]' following whatever data type it is supposed to hold. To instantiate an array, a size must be set for it.<br>
			<p>int[] numbers = new int[];<br>
			String[] words = new String[];<br>
			<h1> ArrayLists </h1>
			<p> An ArrayList is a collection which is similar to an array in that it has elements with indices. But, it can only hold objects (unlike the array which can hold primitive datatypes as well). ArrayLists also don't have a fixed size, elements can be dynamically added or removed. Whenever an element must be added or removed, the size is automatically adjusted by the ArrayList object. The object type the ArrayList holds is enclosed by chevrons '<>'.<br>
			<p> The for loop is used to navigate arrays. Array objects have a length variable which can be accessed publicly via the dot operator (like in any object). So any array's elements can be printed using the following loop:<br>
			<p>for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {<br>
			&nbsp;System.out.println(array[i]);<br>
			}<br>
			<p> A for-each loop (enhanced for loop) is a type of loop that retrieves a collection's elements. For each iteration of the loop, the next element is stored in the loop variable. It is a more convenient way of accessing an array's elements than the example shown above. It can be used with the following syntax:<br>
			<p> for (int i : array) {<br>
			&nbsp;System.out.println(i);<br>
			}<br>
			<p> This works as long as the array is an integer array. If the array has elements of a different datatype, the loop variable's data type must be changed accordingly. The for each loop can be used for any collection, which includes both arrays and ArrayLists.<br>
